## 126. WE (INCLUSIVE)
### Definition
1st person plural inclusive pronoun, i.e. including speaker reference (‘we and you’). Avoid exclusively emphatic or contrastive forms. If there are distinct masculine and feminine forms (e.g. Spanish nosotros/nosotras), then if one is also generic, mixed or unmarked, enter that one (e.g. Spanish nosotros). If there is no generic masculine/feminine form, then (exceptionally) the two forms should be entered as separate 'synonym' lexemes. Avoid dual forms, if different, or honorific forms. If the language has no clusivity distinction, enter the same word in both functions.

### Contexts
We are friends (with you), but he is not our friend.
