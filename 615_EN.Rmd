## 615. SEED GRANULE
### Definition
Generic term for ‘seed’ of any plant; the word that can be applied to as many different plant species as possible. Not specifically ‘fruit-stone’, although the same root may be used for both small and large seeds. To be kept separate from more specialized terms (‘seed for sowing’, ‘moist seed’, ‘seed of a particular group of plants, e.g., cereals’). (GLD) Focus on the sense of an individual seed, in preference to a collective, non-count noun, e.g. French 'graine', not 'semence' (in some languages this may mean a singulative is appropriate). (CoBL)

### Contexts
1. I only had ten seeds to plant and the birds ate them all. (CoBL) 2. When the seed falls on the ground, it grows into a plant. (GLD)
