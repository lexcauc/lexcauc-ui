## 64. MAN
### Definition
Adult human being of the male sex, antonymous to ‘woman’. Should be kept apart from ‘male’ (of any species) if the latter is distinct from ‘man’ (male human), as well as from ‘person / human being’ in general. Context No. 1 is culturally conditioned, in that X and Y should be understood as designations of typical male / female occupations for the given society (e.g., ‘hunting’, ‘cooking’, etc.). If, instead of a general term for ‘man’, one finds differentiation by age groups, the respective lexemes for the age of ca. 20–45 must be treated as synonymous. To be separated from specific designations of ‘bachelor’, ‘widower’ etc. Same contexts as in No.98 ‘woman’. (GLD)

### Contexts
