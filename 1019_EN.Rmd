## 1019. PLAY (TR)
### Definition
Most generic verb, typically transitive, for engaging in a specific game, for the purpose of amusement. Select the transitive verb form, i.e. where followed by the word 'game' or the name of a game. Avoid intransitive/middle/reflexive forms just for amusing oneself without a specific structured game, such as 'have fun', French 's'amuser', etc.. Avoid terms that specifically imply competition, rather than non-serious amusement. Avoid the meaning of playing a musical instrument. (CoBL)
