## 336. NIPPLE
### Definition
The projection of a mammary gland from which, on female mammals, milk can be secreted. (Concepticon) Since eliciting the meaning ‘nipple’ for humans can be challenging due to cultural constraints, the word for animal (e.g. cow) nipples should be entered.

### Contexts
The cow has four nipples.
