## 185. OWL
### Definition
A nocturnal bird of prey of the <i>Strigidae</i> family. Since linguistic terms do not correspond well to the scientific nomenclature, the convention is to enter a medium-sized bird under the meaning ‘owl’, and a larger bird for the meaning ‘eagle-owl’, if there is a separate term.

### Contexts
1. An owl hunts at night. 2. Owls catch mice.
