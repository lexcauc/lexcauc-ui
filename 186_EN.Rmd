## 186. EAGLE-OWL
### Definition
A nocturnal bird of prey of the <i>Strigidae</i> family. Since linguistic terms do not correspond well to the scientific nomenclature, the convention is to enter a medium-sized bird under the meaning ‘owl’, and a larger bird for the meaning ‘eagle-owl’, if there is a separate term.
