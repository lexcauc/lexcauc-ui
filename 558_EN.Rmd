### Definition
A self-standing building used as human habitat. Sometimes ROOM and HOUSE are expressed by the same term, while there is either a separate term for HOUSE proper, or HOUSE proper is expressed by the plural of HOUSE/ROOM. In this case this entry should include the term for HOUSE specifically, as there is a separate entry for ROOM.
